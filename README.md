# Titanic-Exploration
Exploring survival rates of passengers on the titanic by demographic features.

####Summary####
This is part of a Udactity project on making visualizations.  The direction I am taking this project is of one that presents some interesting relationships I found in the data and then provide flexibility for users to easily explore that data as well.  I chose this data set because it is a largely known event in history and would be easy for users to understand.

####Design####
This is my first HTML/CSS project in a long time and my first project in Javascript ever, so I wanted a design that was simple but effective.  A control panel is crucial because I want users to be able to change between the three measurement I found to be useful.  Also, comparing survival to the full population counts were important.  I also wanted a data dictionary to help people understand what they are filtering and clarify the processed columns I added to the data set.
I chose a three panel layout to make it easy to view the control panel, visualization and data dictionary.  I also used the bootstrap framework because it has built in resizing functionality which I used to transition my basic 3 column layout to a single column if the screen is below a certain width.
The color of the background and the text has a slightly nautical theme, which I felt to be suitable.
I do wish I had more capability/time to give the form a more professional appearance.
