# Titanic-Exploration
Exploring survival rates of passengers on the titanic by demographic features.

####Summary####

This is part of a Udactity project on making visualizations.  The direction I am taking this project is of one that presents some interesting relationships I found in the data and then provide flexibility for users to easily explore that data as well.  I chose this data set because it is a largely known event in history and would be easy for users to understand.

####Design####

This is my first HTML/CSS project in a long time and my first project in Javascript ever, so I wanted a design that was simple but effective.  A control panel is crucial because I want users to be able to change between the three measurement I found to be useful.  Also, comparing survival to the full population counts were important.  I also wanted a data dictionary to help people understand what they are filtering and clarify the processed columns I added to the data set.
I chose a three panel layout to make it easy to view the control panel, visualization and data dictionary.  I also used the bootstrap framework because it has built in resizing functionality which I used to transition my basic 3 column layout to a single column if the screen is below a certain width.
The color of the background and the text has a slightly nautical theme, which I felt to be suitable.
I do wish I had more capability/time to give the form a more professional appearance.

####Feedback####

"The sizing of the text on the base page is too small and not comparable to the other 'slides'"

"The speed of the animation isn't always long enough and sometimes is too long"

####Resources####

There is going to be a lot here.  I had to do a lot of self education since I have never done a project like this.

This one is not in the project, but would be something I would like to learn more about.
